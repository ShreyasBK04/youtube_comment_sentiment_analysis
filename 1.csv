@panamafred1,"When you said CD = Change Directory, I went into a time warp. I bought my first PC in 1984. It had a massive 10 meg hard drive! I knew absolutely nothing about computers. Didn't even know anyone who had one. The computer came with a thick three-ring binder with the title, DOS. I read and reread and reread the entire book until it started to make sense. (The first version of Windows didn't come out until 1985.) In 1985, I bought an early copy of Symantec's Q&A, a (non-Windows) word processor, flat file, and report generator, which relied heavily on keystroke combinations to get things done but was hinting at a graphical interface. I ran a non-profit for many years with Q&A and loved it, such an improvement from WordStar. So, now at 72-years-old, to see CD = Change Directory, I say to myself, ""Hey, I can do this."" Thanks for a good tutorial.",1

@illhaveawtrplz,"What an amazing explanation, thank you so much for being so clear and concise!

A tip for new learners like myself: This video is slightly dated. GitHub now refers to the primary branch as ""main"" and not ""master"". If you try to run these commands exactly like Gwen in the video, you'll run into errors. Remember: main ️ master ",1
@unknownuser6577,"This tutorial is probably the best github tutorial any beginner online could make use of. The lecture was succinct and it passed the desired information to the viewers, not having to make things overly complicated, she explains it so well.",1
@mohammadfallah.rasoulnejad5379,she is the most fluent instructor that answered all my questions while i was watching... imma go to her channel and subscribe rn.,1
@MegaRomza,"At some point I thought I was dumb for not gasping the concept of git and GitHub because I’ve watched over 5 courses which were paid but I was getting even more frustrated. But here you are making it all clear, now I have the ahaaaaaaaaa moment. I’m in love with your teaching methods, they make sense to me and now I can rewatch those other courses. Thank you very much!!!",1
@obotandino2941,4 years after and this is still insightful. Thank you so much.,1
@josemgarlla74,"Really love this git and github intro course, it really touches a lot of things.
1. How to create a repo locally through the CLI(Command Line Interface) or directly from GITHUB
2. git flow by using the most common commands: git add - git commit and git push/git pull, all of them with their corresponding explanation. What ""origin"", ""remote"" and ""master"" mean.
3. git branching: all the commands involve in that kind of operation as well as best practices.
4. git merging: when we use a ""feature"" branch and it's time to merge to the ""master"" branch  -- PR (Pull Request) on the Github side
5. How to deal with ""conflicts"" when merging.
6. Undoing in git: undoing from the stage area versus undoing if we have committed once or several times.
7. Understanding how and why we fork a repo on github.


Really awesome content, thank a lot for such a valuable content.",1
@adraintokyo7994,"This is an excellent, detailed tutorial for Git and GitHub.  It’s long, but easy to follow, not least because there is no distracting music, no annoying jingles or graphics and perhaps most helpful, the narration is measured and carefully modulated ... you quickly feel at home with the delivery, from someone who really knows their subject material.",1
@kaitoti,"Thank you, 
Maybe some suggestions, 
 - add the changes of github defaulting to ""main"" instead of master and the configs on it.
 - Setting up SSH keys(20:30) first must be earlier than the cloning through VS Code(14:30), so we can follow along",1
@jmdavaul,"This was much better than I expected it to be.  Very ""no fluff,"" clear, and bite sized.   You can find these topics in many places (youtube, udemy, skillshare, etc) but most instructors can't seem to explain these topics  plainly.   You did exactly that, nice job.  You covered the core concepts of branching, merging, PR's, conflict resolutions, and undoing changes in very easy to follow and digestible steps ",1
@AbdulRahman-n1g,"Here are git commands to remember:-

@vishakarudhra8665,"For beginners like me, who might be feeling lost with commands not working in the VS code terminal, all these commands will work on Git Bash since it can interpret all UNIX commands and git ones, on the top of it, it will track the edits you separately perform on VS code.

@doniyorallabergenov7970,"Took me 5 days to completely learn your 1hour course but I repeated it over and over until I completely got it! Very useful, no nonsense and easy to understand. The only thing is, I think the location of SSH keys in the video got changed and placed after 'commit' and 'push' but it is necessary to set up before those steps. Took me a minute to figure that out. Thank you so much!",1

@icono__7136,"I feel so relived; I'm finally learning this darn thing! Thank you for the tutorial. Thank you for taking the time to do this Gwen!

Edit: Upon reviewing the tutorial again, I'd like to say:

1. When creating a tutorial, you guys should  understand the importance of slowing down to the pace of the learner. In the beginning you walk us through a nice set of key terms (which was exceptional), then start mixing lots of advanced and beginner-level concepts together in your explanations, confusing the person that's watching the video. Slow down, explain like we're 5, that's why we're here.

2. To expand upon the issue of mixing things up I mentioned above, it's okay to keep a tutorial short, and add footnotes later if you think that the advanced concepts you're touching on are still worth being aware of. That way, the beginner can truly focus their attention on the basics, and then access the footnote only when they feel comfortable with the knowledge they've acquired thus far, making the content of your footnotes even more effective. After all, isn't good programming about being efficient? 

I used to get annoyed at being expected to take additional English classes as a Computer Science student, but now I understand why. I spent 4 hours yesterday debugging a Terminal issue, only to later realize that there was an ""issue"" because the person who created the how-to GitHub document instructed the reader to paste this code into the Terminal command line: 



They said to  this command in the terminal (meaning: include the quotation marks). After 4 hours of learning about chmod, File Links, Groups, root directory, Inodes—things I knew NOTHING about prior to this, I resolved my problem by simply removing the quotation marks. 

Now, the arrogant developer might say, ""Well that's obvious"". No it's not! The person said ""paste"", meaning I would: 

- Select the piece of code
- Apply ctrl+c to it, for Windows (cmd+c on Mac)
- Go to the Terminal and apply ctrl+v/cmd+v

Either the tutorial should have been made like this: 

 ,  

or the person writing the document should I mentioned that the quotation marks need to be removed. 

As Software Engineering becomes more collaborative, programmers can no longer get away with being asocial, and communication impaired, so this is an area a lot more engineers need to start being proficient in .",1
@CassCodeIt,"So as a self taught developer this has not been my first time looking into Git, but this the first time commands lines were explained even better which is good. 

Most places I would only get commands and work from there not knowing how to and when to use them.

Gwen here, did a great job explaining and sharing the common usage and howwhen to. I am now confident to continue working and learning git.
Thanks greate content.",1

Usually this doesn't show when you have a "".gitignore"" file set to ignore it in you app's folder. Probably Gwen turned off the automatic creation of this file globally in her terminal by running: defaults write com.apple.desktopservices DSDontWriteNetworkStores true

You can turn it back on by running: defaults write com.apple.desktopservices DSDontWriteNetworkStores false

@CamaguNcoso,"I have been watching this video after installing Git on my Windows 10. There are few points I have to make

1. This video was created 3yrs ago, the GitHub was not yet advanced compared to how it is now. Yes I have Github account thanks to this video

2. Visual Studio Code is also advanced because there's an option that allows you to clone without going to the terminal. You simply copy the address of the repository you want to clone in Github and past it on the address box on VSCode.

Which makes the video to be outdated given the fact that VSC and Github have advanced since this video was shot. I struggled until I saw the differences between Github 2023 Sep 16 and the one used in the video(3yrs ago). Same applies for VSC, it is so advanced thanks to the developers of Microsoft

From there, I struggle to follow through bcos you're using a different operating system compared to Windows 10 That I'm using",1

My  goal is to be able to setup a git repository with all of the bash aliases and scripts that I want in a repo so that when I setup new devices I can clone all that without futzing around with usb sticks and such.

i started watching these guys first then since i trust freecodecamp's organized style of explaining things(  because i learn from them), i started with your video first.

when i watched kevin's git tutorial, i noticed for unstaging he used restore -staged not reset, also for branching he used git branch branch_new_name but you used checkout ...

@dgtlalchmst,"FWIW, 

git add vs git commit
----------------------------------
- ""git add"" sends a modified file in your working repository to the staging area; files are NOT committed
- ""git commit"" saves files from the staging area; takes a snapshot of your repository's current state, and creates a new revision with a log. each version has a unique identifier.

commit vs push
--------------------------
- commit only saves files locally 
- push sends committed (saved) files to a [specified] remote repository

working directory --> staging area --> local repository --> remote repository
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
working directory files are sent to the staging area via ""git add"". 
staging area files are added and saved to your local repository via ""git commit"".
local repository files are added to a remote repository via ""git push"".

1. it would have been super helpful to show how to set up ssh earlier on. I struggled because I had never set up an SSH key in GitHub and the way the tutorial is laid out it is unclear how to set up SSH. I found my answer on stack overflow however.

2. how do you get your terminal to be set up like that where it shows the branch? my terminal doesn't show anything to indicate I am in git or which branch I am in (not in VS code and not in terminal either).
