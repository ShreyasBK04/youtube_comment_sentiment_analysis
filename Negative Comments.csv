@sawazalz9764,"16:28 if you are having problem with using command ""ls -la"", make sure that you change your terminal into Bash first. To change your terminal,
1. Head to the upper right corner on terminal and press the drop-down menu.
2. Select ""Git Bash"" terminal.
3. Start using the command ""ls -la"" there."
@ashleyteece4237,"The default name of the initial branch is now called ""main"" not ""master"". So if anyone is haveing trouble at 25:50, you need to use ""git push origin main"" not ""git push origin master"""

@vaclavjochim177,"What happened at 21:45? Also my path is weird (Windows)

 C:\Users\Vaclav/.ssh/id_rsa

what is ls | grep? That command does not exist... Anything after  does not work, any help highly appreciated"
@samuelonyango5355,"I really learned alot form this, some concepts that initially were not clear to me are now solid."
@viswashh,24:40 I am really confused here
@j_force.90,"21:46 -  If the given command line doesn't work try using the following. (Got it from chatgpt and it worked.)

ls -Name | Select-String -Pattern 'testkey'  

The previous error which leads to the above solution might have occurred bcz of using windows powershell. Widows powershell doesn't have the 'grep' command natively available.
Instead we can use 'Select-String' cmdlet, which performs a similar function to 'grep'

Or else your can use grep command in bash:"
@rakibulhasanrajumeazi680,Thank you so much for this initiative. I was really confused about using git before watching this video.
-,I followed your tutorial step by step. I was able to get visual studio and github to interface. however I cannot commit and push my changes from my local on Visual Studio to my Repo on Github. I am utterly confused what I am doing wrong as I followed each step specifically you showed us. thank you for taking the time to make these helpful videos !
@omikronweapon,"I feel there's a few steps that could benefit from some details at 25:03
trying to register my key, I found that -K wasnt recognised, while -k was.
also, as an absolute beginner, I failed to realise that ~/.ssh was refering to a directory the repo in the video didnt have.
so ""ssh-add -k testkey"" was what I needed"
@pitsil,"15:11 - cloning through vs code: Clone with SSH didn't work in my case as i was getting auth error, so i used  clone with HTTPS instead and it worked."
@btross3154,"This is the exact crash course I needed.
Life saverrrrrrr
Thank you very much "
@randyraymor1963,"This is a very detailed video.  Unfortunately, being an older video, I found it difficult to follow.  For one thing, GitHub has changed a bit since this video was made.  But the real show stopper is that you are 90% devoted to Mac and I'm using Windows.  It's hard enough for some people to learn new things, let alone, trying to convert commands to different operation systems."
@akashgillella,"Oh my god!

Thanks a lot for this Mam!

Git has become more of a idiotic traumatic experience for me. I'm a 4th yr CSE UG, and still don't know my way around git comfortably!!!! I just wanna go and hide in a hole.

Really thanks for this!"
@squidux,I filled in some knowledge gaps with this video. I didn't have a good image in my mind for a software development workflow until this very beginner-friendly video.
@a9mission439,THANKYOU MISS FARADAY
@alvindavid_,"Thank You so much, I was so lost now everything just looks  straightforward."
@josephaj8310,"Its the best, I looked every others and those were not good. Thanks for the teaching."
@matheuscosta-fq7it,"if you're having problem with push, try the follow command  
git push -u origin main
in some cases the right name is main and not master, you can change it at github settings"
@satvikpandey700,"At 30:00 some people might face an error ""src refspec does not match any""
This is arising as git do not know the branch main so before this command add this -
git branch -M main"
@python_knooobb,"At timeline 15:32, you have not shown us the command, but when we try it is giving with fatal error"
@flexibleminded245,"i didnt understand 24:17 - 25:26 , when i write this : vim ~/.ssh/config  its not giving me same result of yours. why? and what is PIN for authenticator , i made as you said but it says failure."
@BlackHawkDown2,"15:00 I get an error "" You don't have any public SSH keys in your GitHub account. You can add a new public key, or try cloning this repository via HTTPS."" . This itself is a long process :-( I was hoping you would cover it in the video"
@misatokatsuragi9111,Thank you so much this was so intimidating as a beginner
@John-r8b1x,"FOR WINDOWS USERS
1. For those struggling with permission denied(publickey) error try the following:
=>when generating key, just enter when it says enter file in which to save the key(do not enter anything)
=>proceed the same as it is 

2. FAILED TO PUSH SOME REFS TO
=> after committing do add => git branch -M main

And also master has been replaced by main in the latest version ."
@pratickbhowmick4796,"16:40 'ls -la' gives error in Windows.
20:42 In which app are you writing these cmds?"
@anonymous-random,"51:39  I think this part is a bit misleading. Even when it's not the same line, the merge error should occur, right?"
@olboytom2079,"Also, if you get an error at the 30min mark when entering the push command it could be caused by adding a license etc to the folder. You must create the folder with no options for it to work. Can add license later."
@planetside11,"Good video if you're using a Mac. But if you're running Windows you'll hit some brick walls...

For those of us running windows, we don't have the ""cat"" command. Use ""type"" instead. 
We also don't have pbcopy. Use clip < [well-formed path to your file]
No idea what to do about starting the SSH agent. Been looking for the past 30 min. Still can't find a way to start it that works."
@whale6125,"For someone who fails to push 'Demo 2' with an error message saying ""error: src refspec main does not match any"", you need to do ""git branch -M main"" before ""git remote add origin .....""."
@primordialcat6986,for anyone having trouble on git push origin master use main instead of master
@scroopynoopers9824,"having trouble at at 25:25

@angelinaceppaluni811,When I try to follow along I am met with an error message. Is there something I should be doing differently?
@Me-kt3gh,"For me, hitting tab does not autocomplete the branch names. any ideas?

Also, my terminal has the entire directory which is quite ugly. How do I get it to be just the folder name?
I'm also curious if it is just a windows thing, but my terminal doesn't specify which branch I am in. The only way to tell is to do the git branch command. Is there a way to change that?"
@drewstowell5926,"I keep getting stuck at the ""Cloning through VS Code"" part. I try using the git clone command, and VS says it doesn't recognize that command. I'm on Windows, not sure what I'm doing wrong. I've followed everything up to that point and it was working fine.

Update: I closed out of Visual Studio and ran Git Bash to see if it would do anything. I closed GB and the next time I opened VSC, I could use the git clone command."

@Ndunda_Kelvin,"When i write cd demo it tells me no such  file or directory. When i refer to it as demo-repo yes i go to the folder but no master. Don't judge me, just new to git."
@gamezszsz,when I would try git push it would prompt me for a username and password for github. and the password wasn't my github password it I had to generate a personal access token. have no idea why that didn't happen in the vid so confusing
@mannistudio,"Luv'd this course.  BUT, I got myself in a bit of a jam.  I was in a directory that has several sub-dirs which also contain files.  I believe I accidentally typed in:  git add . (dot) which then added every subdir + files into git as untracked.  Not good as I now have many, many dirs & files in untracked status.  I did not do a commit (thank gawd).  So, i tried all kinds of combos of:  git clean;  git clean -fd & git rm --cached on just a few files or on a subdir/files (backed up of course) and found that these commands actually delete the file on disk along with untracked files in the work area.  This is really bad.  So how do I back out of this predicament? Here is an example.  Each dir ha many files:

$ git status -s
?? ./
?? ../Javascript/
?? ../SquareAPI/
?? ../Project X/
?? ../Project Y/"
@itsgojoverfr,"I wonder if anyone had the same problem as me when I used 'git push origin master' command in my CLI. Turns out the branch isn't called 'master' anymore, now its called 'main'. So try 'git push origin main' instead"
@vatroslavzapletal6428,can you make an update? github has changed the pages menu. Iam confused
@gporto.,Note to self: the stuff you always spend an embarrassing amount of time searching for is @ 26:39
@MattLozier314,when I issue: $ git push origin main  I am prompted for my github credentials.  I enter them but then recieve a message that this form of authentication is no longer supported.  Anyone else have this problem?
@daniellaregal7432,Hey guys I'm having issues with the ssh key and agent parts partly because I'm using a Windows and she's using a Mac so I'm confused. I keep trying to add the ssh key to the ssh-agent but the terminal keeps telling me that there is no test key file and the test key is literally there
@harunrhimu,Thanks for quitting the fear of git and github.
@bassycounter,either i'm brain dead or literally every single resource I've tried using to set up ssh so I can clone my own repo to my machine is false information.
@SergejBichek,"sorry I got only until 17 minutes and already got 3 problems
1)could not pull data from github 
needed to create key for ssh

2)could not open folder with command cd demo
tried with cd demo-repo and it kind of worked
(so i guess you cropped video in bad place)

3)still cant see file inside with command ls -ls

so overall hard to follow tutorial if every step is not working
maybe someone has solution that i don't know"
