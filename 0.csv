@sawazalz9764,"16:28 if you are having problem with using command ""ls -la"", make sure that you change your terminal into Bash first. To change your terminal,
1. Head to the upper right corner on terminal and press the drop-down menu.
2. Select ""Git Bash"" terminal.
3. Start using the command ""ls -la"" there.",0

@j_force.90,"21:46 -  If the given command line doesn't work try using the following. (Got it from chatgpt and it worked.)

ls -Name | Select-String -Pattern 'testkey'  

The previous error which leads to the above solution might have occurred bcz of using windows powershell. Widows powershell doesn't have the 'grep' command natively available.
Instead we can use 'Select-String' cmdlet, which performs a similar function to 'grep'

Or else your can use grep command in bash:",0
@rakibulhasanrajumeazi680,Thank you so much for this initiative. I was really confused about using git before watching this video.,0
-,I followed your tutorial step by step. I was able to get visual studio and github to interface. however I cannot commit and push my changes from my local on Visual Studio to my Repo on Github. I am utterly confused what I am doing wrong as I followed each step specifically you showed us. thank you for taking the time to make these helpful videos !,0
@omikronweapon,"I feel there's a few steps that could benefit from some details at 25:03
trying to register my key, I found that -K wasnt recognised, while -k was.
also, as an absolute beginner, I failed to realise that ~/.ssh was refering to a directory the repo in the video didnt have.
so ""ssh-add -k testkey"" was what I needed",0

@randyraymor1963,"This is a very detailed video.  Unfortunately, being an older video, I found it difficult to follow.  For one thing, GitHub has changed a bit since this video was made.  But the real show stopper is that you are 90% devoted to Mac and I'm using Windows.  It's hard enough for some people to learn new things, let alone, trying to convert commands to different operation systems.",0

@mannistudio,"Luv'd this course.  BUT, I got myself in a bit of a jam.  I was in a directory that has several sub-dirs which also contain files.  I believe I accidentally typed in:  git add . (dot) which then added every subdir + files into git as untracked.  Not good as I now have many, many dirs & files in untracked status.  I did not do a commit (thank gawd).  So, i tried all kinds of combos of:  git clean;  git clean -fd & git rm --cached on just a few files or on a subdir/files (backed up of course) and found that these commands actually delete the file on disk along with untracked files in the work area.  This is really bad.  So how do I back out of this predicament? Here is an example.  Each dir ha many files:

$ git status -s
?? ./
?? ../Javascript/
?? ../SquareAPI/
?? ../Project X/
?? ../Project Y/",0
