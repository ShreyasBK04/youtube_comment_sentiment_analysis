@FaradayAcademy,"Hey everyone, thanks for watching 
If you want to support my work, I wrote a book on learning to code: https://amzn.to/3a911Rk (US) and https://books2read.com/u/4DgO8D (worldwide)"
@hassansyed6087,"Gotta love humans who just give thousands of dollars of knowledge for absolutely free.
What a wonderful individual 
Thanks for this"
@panamafred1,"When you said CD = Change Directory, I went into a time warp. I bought my first PC in 1984. It had a massive 10 meg hard drive! I knew absolutely nothing about computers. Didn't even know anyone who had one. The computer came with a thick three-ring binder with the title, DOS. I read and reread and reread the entire book until it started to make sense. (The first version of Windows didn't come out until 1985.) In 1985, I bought an early copy of Symantec's Q&A, a (non-Windows) word processor, flat file, and report generator, which relied heavily on keystroke combinations to get things done but was hinting at a graphical interface. I ran a non-profit for many years with Q&A and loved it, such an improvement from WordStar. So, now at 72-years-old, to see CD = Change Directory, I say to myself, ""Hey, I can do this."" Thanks for a good tutorial."
@WendyLiChinLim,"Gwen articulated this topic so well and was able to break it down into simple terms for a newbie like me. She also explained everything very clearly, showcasing her intelligence in simplifying complicated concepts with ease. I am very grateful to have stumbled upon this video."

@fabriciosaavedra3795,"I don't usually leave comments for tutorials, but let me say, this one fit like a glove to my newbie needs. Thanks a lot!"
@sawazalz9764,"16:28 if you are having problem with using command ""ls -la"", make sure that you change your terminal into Bash first. To change your terminal,
1. Head to the upper right corner on terminal and press the drop-down menu.
2. Select ""Git Bash"" terminal.
3. Start using the command ""ls -la"" there."
@anuvapandya8287,"Whole course was broken down into heading and sub-headings, spending time on important ones and you made sure the basics were clear to the students, viewers or learners like me. Thank You Gwen."
@illhaveawtrplz,"What an amazing explanation, thank you so much for being so clear and concise!

A tip for new learners like myself: This video is slightly dated. GitHub now refers to the primary branch as ""main"" and not ""master"". If you try to run these commands exactly like Gwen in the video, you'll run into errors. Remember: main ️ master "
@unknownuser6577,"This tutorial is probably the best github tutorial any beginner online could make use of. The lecture was succinct and it passed the desired information to the viewers, not having to make things overly complicated, she explains it so well."
@mohammadfallah.rasoulnejad5379,she is the most fluent instructor that answered all my questions while i was watching... imma go to her channel and subscribe rn.
@MegaRomza,"At some point I thought I was dumb for not gasping the concept of git and GitHub because I’ve watched over 5 courses which were paid but I was getting even more frustrated. But here you are making it all clear, now I have the ahaaaaaaaaa moment. I’m in love with your teaching methods, they make sense to me and now I can rewatch those other courses. Thank you very much!!!"
@obotandino2941,4 years after and this is still insightful. Thank you so much.
@josemgarlla74,"Really love this git and github intro course, it really touches a lot of things.
1. How to create a repo locally through the CLI(Command Line Interface) or directly from GITHUB
2. git flow by using the most common commands: git add - git commit and git push/git pull, all of them with their corresponding explanation. What ""origin"", ""remote"" and ""master"" mean.
3. git branching: all the commands involve in that kind of operation as well as best practices.
4. git merging: when we use a ""feature"" branch and it's time to merge to the ""master"" branch  -- PR (Pull Request) on the Github side
5. How to deal with ""conflicts"" when merging.
6. Undoing in git: undoing from the stage area versus undoing if we have committed once or several times.
7. Understanding how and why we fork a repo on github.


Really awesome content, thank a lot for such a valuable content."
@adraintokyo7994,"This is an excellent, detailed tutorial for Git and GitHub.  It’s long, but easy to follow, not least because there is no distracting music, no annoying jingles or graphics and perhaps most helpful, the narration is measured and carefully modulated ... you quickly feel at home with the delivery, from someone who really knows their subject material."
@kaitoti,"Thank you, 
Maybe some suggestions, 
 - add the changes of github defaulting to ""main"" instead of master and the configs on it.
 - Setting up SSH keys(20:30) first must be earlier than the cloning through VS Code(14:30), so we can follow along"
@jmdavaul,"This was much better than I expected it to be.  Very ""no fluff,"" clear, and bite sized.   You can find these topics in many places (youtube, udemy, skillshare, etc) but most instructors can't seem to explain these topics  plainly.   You did exactly that, nice job.  You covered the core concepts of branching, merging, PR's, conflict resolutions, and undoing changes in very easy to follow and digestible steps "
@AbdulRahman-n1g,"Here are git commands to remember:-
1. git status
2. git add .(for all) / git add <filename>
3. git commit -m ""message""
4. git commit -am ""message""
5. git push
6. git push -u origin <branchname>
7. git pull
8. git branch
9. git branch -d
10. git checkout -b <new_branchname>
11. git checkout branchname
12. git reset
13. git reset <filename>
14. git reset -HEAD
15. git reset -HEAD~1 (OR) git reset -HEAD~2 and so on...
16. git reset -hard <commit_code>"
@vishakarudhra8665,"For beginners like me, who might be feeling lost with commands not working in the VS code terminal, all these commands will work on Git Bash since it can interpret all UNIX commands and git ones, on the top of it, it will track the edits you separately perform on VS code. So feel free and just git bash through this course."
@_AnikSaha,"At 21:43, One important note:: If you choose a new name instead of automatically generated location, you have to use that location name when adding configuration code to the [~/.ssh/config] file. Nice tutorial. Thank you."
@vigneshwarselva9276,"i'm a non native speaker of english, what i loved a lot here is your slow n steady way of illustrations, was a nice video .. thanks u so  much"
@GTFreeFlyer,I finally understand Git after this video.  I’ve asked so many questions to friends and watched several “quick” YouTube tutorials and was still confused about Git.  Your tutorial was excellent and I’m glad I sat through the whole hour of it.  It was completely worth my time.  Thanks!
@manelariapala7852,The first ever instructor that actually explains the meaning of each jargon! Thanks @Faraday Academy!
@DefnitelyNotFred,"Absolute masterpiece of a Tutorial. I'm an electrical engineer working as a Data Analyst with Energy Data. I'm trying to shore up my programming credentials as a Data Scientist because I'm trying to change jobs and have failed a lot of interviews for not having enough knowledge on Git, so this guide is very welcome :D"
@GreatBibleStudies,"Gwen, your video is great! I love how everything is broken down into bite-size chunks. You have a wonderful gift of teaching. You've helped this beginner get closer to becoming a competent user of Git & GitHub."
@SiddharthMathur2k007,The most complete tutorial for beginners I have seen on YouTube so far! Thanks a lot!
@doniyorallabergenov7970,"Took me 5 days to completely learn your 1hour course but I repeated it over and over until I completely got it! Very useful, no nonsense and easy to understand. The only thing is, I think the location of SSH keys in the video got changed and placed after 'commit' and 'push' but it is necessary to set up before those steps. Took me a minute to figure that out. Thank you so much!"
@joseortiz_io,Version control is definitely a crucial tool for developing software. Thank you for the education! ️
@guitarman813,This so far is the best (free) course that I've seen on Git and GitHub. Bravo Gwen!
@cosmo_gon,"Gwen has such a clear and pleasant voice and a perfect diction! Likewise, she has a very good teaching skills. Thanks, Gwen!"
@oldlorenz9567,"I 've watched a lot of Git tutorials, and this is for sure the best I've ever seen. Thanks !"
@mikeantonin7580,"This was a highly comprehensive and helpful Git tutorial. It was definitely worth the full hour because unlike other shorter tutorials, it covered everything extensively (with appropriate examples too) thus helping me to properly understand the basic concepts and operations of Git as well as use cases, Thank you very much!"
@ojeleyeopeyemi656,"This will go down in history as the best Git and GitHub course for beginners! Even if one is a dummy, one will still get. Kudos."
@whoismikeyuk,"This has to be the best introduction to git and GitHub I have seen to date (yes, I have tried watching a number of videos). Easy to follow and clearly explained. Finally understanding ""git push origin main"" (changed from master) was my favourite part. Thank you."
@sakthipro_YT,"Extremely useful, sharing a fewthings..
For latest Windows client on VScode,

1. Cloning via ssh doesn't work but via https does.

2. On Key generation, SSH for rsa doesn't work, but the new syntax & algorithm ed25519 published in Github help page works.

3. Same for starting & config ssh agent, the github help page commands worked.

Thanks a lot for this video."
@sauravroy3420,Really like that you took the time to explain each concept in detail for a beginner like me
@bernardbakala9241,I learned more that I expected. Thanks a million for such a complete course.
@kirtperez9938,Y’all are amazing! Pumping out this much needed content especially during these times.
@saurabhbhardwaj7951,"I have been making mindless commits and PRs without realizing what they actually meant. This course fills so many gaps and answers most of my question regarding why we do a certain thing in Git.
Thanks a Lot!!"
@abdulhannan288,"This is exactly what a beginner would need ..
a great course covered in so timely manner"
@CSharpProdigy,"This is top notch I must say. I rarely give comments, but by default I'm doing so now.."
@briankaboyi-j1e,"As a beginner, I've understood a lot about git and GitHub that I was struggling with just by following along with this video. Thanks You"
@user-di4js6xw9n,"absolutely loved this video! as someone who was absolutely in the dark about how to use git and github, this crashcourse most definitely provided me with all the necessary information a beginner would need! thank you! :)"
@mattmovesmountains1443,"So helpful and well-explained. As a new coder, I'm in near disbelief that this is the setup process for what seems to be the tool used by every professional coder. That said I'm even more thankful you explained it so well."
@alexandergracilla1394,This video has better sound quality than the ad that came before
@faraza5161,This was definitely one of the best git tutorials I have ever come across. Big Thanks Gwen!!!
@piyushdongre325,This has taught me all i needed to know about git which i was delaying for a long time. Thank you :)
@ashleyteece4237,"The default name of the initial branch is now called ""main"" not ""master"". So if anyone is haveing trouble at 25:50, you need to use ""git push origin main"" not ""git push origin master"""
@icono__7136,"I feel so relived; I'm finally learning this darn thing! Thank you for the tutorial. Thank you for taking the time to do this Gwen!

Edit: Upon reviewing the tutorial again, I'd like to say:

1. When creating a tutorial, you guys should  understand the importance of slowing down to the pace of the learner. In the beginning you walk us through a nice set of key terms (which was exceptional), then start mixing lots of advanced and beginner-level concepts together in your explanations, confusing the person that's watching the video. Slow down, explain like we're 5, that's why we're here.

2. To expand upon the issue of mixing things up I mentioned above, it's okay to keep a tutorial short, and add footnotes later if you think that the advanced concepts you're touching on are still worth being aware of. That way, the beginner can truly focus their attention on the basics, and then access the footnote only when they feel comfortable with the knowledge they've acquired thus far, making the content of your footnotes even more effective. After all, isn't good programming about being efficient? 

I used to get annoyed at being expected to take additional English classes as a Computer Science student, but now I understand why. I spent 4 hours yesterday debugging a Terminal issue, only to later realize that there was an ""issue"" because the person who created the how-to GitHub document instructed the reader to paste this code into the Terminal command line: 



They said to  this command in the terminal (meaning: include the quotation marks). After 4 hours of learning about chmod, File Links, Groups, root directory, Inodes—things I knew NOTHING about prior to this, I resolved my problem by simply removing the quotation marks. 

Now, the arrogant developer might say, ""Well that's obvious"". No it's not! The person said ""paste"", meaning I would: 

- Select the piece of code
- Apply ctrl+c to it, for Windows (cmd+c on Mac)
- Go to the Terminal and apply ctrl+v/cmd+v

Either the tutorial should have been made like this: 

 ,  

or the person writing the document should I mentioned that the quotation marks need to be removed. 

As Software Engineering becomes more collaborative, programmers can no longer get away with being asocial, and communication impaired, so this is an area a lot more engineers need to start being proficient in ."
@CassCodeIt,"So as a self taught developer this has not been my first time looking into Git, but this the first time commands lines were explained even better which is good. 

Most places I would only get commands and work from there not knowing how to and when to use them.

Gwen here, did a great job explaining and sharing the common usage and howwhen to. I am now confident to continue working and learning git.
Thanks greate content."
@samuraijack5919,"When I get my job in web development, you can be sure that I'm coming back to help you guys out."
@rerere7702,I'm literally five minutes in and I can already tell that you put great detail into this video. Keep up the great work!
@jinyoungchoi3443,This video is amazing! I failed to understand Github for several years until I came across this video. Thanks!
@tjex,"21:34 - you need to type in the full file path with the desired file name at the end. eg. /Users/tillman/.ssh/[insert desired file name]
Otherwise it just ends up in the root of the Home folder. Just so people know. Could cause confusion."
@VishalGupta-xw2rp,You People are like a Blessing... Like Water in Dessert... You People are too Good for us. May the Force be with you️🇮🇳
@JIHYELEE-h2m,I'm not native speaker of English. So I really appreciate your speed of speaking. Thanks a lot!
@alanmurray4011,Thanks Gwen. This is the best beginner tutorial I have come across for Git and GitHub. What makes it the best is that you don't assume that any bit of information is too trivial or unimportant to mention. I feel a lot more comfortable on the topic now. Thanks again!
@Kawaremu,I really learnt many things out of this video and I'm finally able to dive into version controls softwaare yeeeea!
@criscrawford4615,"Thanks - I forgot everything ""git"" in the last year and relearned it all plus more after watching this one hour video."
@ei_acc,"If you're a new to web development this is very important, precisely what I was looking for. thanks for this amazing content"
@bkatsevych,Probably the best Git and GitHub crash course newcomers can have. Thanks a lot for a perfectly done job!
@SuperLm21,"The way you are explaining your voice timming is just perfect to go along . I´m confident using Git now and it´s no longer a monster , off course it needs practice . Thanks from Portugal!"
@user-vq5gv1vg3w,"You did an amazing job, I don't collaborate on any projects and just used git for tracking changes over time, making my github page look busy, and project copypasta. But this reminded me how immensely useful git is; built a reference guide around your video Thank you!"
@thecalgarians4597,"It's the best Git / Github tutorial out there and that too at no cost to the learner.
Amazingly explained all important and, I believe, the most commonly used git commands / Github operations in such an easy to understand manner.
I feel so confident now in using git/github from earlier being a Zero in this space.
I'd spcially acknowledge the slow pace of Gwen's speaking while explaining all these concepts.
Wonderful job done, Gwen.
Thank a ton!!!!!"
@tradewithaakash2939,5 min into the video and i already know that this is the correct video to understand git and git-hub.
@MS-wv8nk,"Gwen, your tutorial is absolutely excellent! I am so grateful for IT pros like you! You are very clear, thorough, detailed. I've always wanted to better understand Git & Github and I believe you are my answer to learn how to make use of these great tools. It's SO nice to have a non-judgmental pro who makes sense and doesn't teach as if most of us out here already know what the tool does and how we can benefit from it. Hopefully I can teach my friends in time. I've just become your newest subscriber, so many thanks and please keep up the excellent teaching. I'm excited and now engaged...I've just got to make time to learn it and learn it well.

Much respect.
 - MS!"
@charlesagyei9200,The best Git tutorial I’ve ever had. Straight to the point and clear explanations to the important features. Thank you so much
@bahador924,by far this was the best course on GitHub I have ever seen.
@EricTighten,"Just to make it clear, if you don't have your ssh set up yet, you won't be able to clone the repo to your local machine, which is at around 15:05 of this tutorial"
@brickviking667,"Thank you for this course, it seems to be a great refresher. My only comment about the content is that at least at my end, the audio is really quiet in comparison to a lot of the other videos I look at. I'm not sure if this is deliberate."
@prabhatkumarsingh5728,"You guys are awesome, I was waiting for this video and here it is only in few days "
@bkahumuza,Thanks Gwen for one of the most clear explanations I have had in life. Was lost till I found this Video. Thanks!
@theshilpitube,"Thank you very much! I learned a lot! I wish you'd add a git log after the last git reset that you did... but it's okay, I can always recreate the project and see how it looks. Thank you again for this tutorial! You are a good teacher!"
@aldrinseanpereira140,"When first opening the terminal in VS Code,  on the terminal bar just change from ""powershell"" to ""Git Bash"" and then follow along"
@chahalamit,Best Github Tutorial so far! Hands down. Couldnt appreciate more that how she has considered detailing the tiniest of things about git and github.
@iMiike69,"Much appreciated Gwen! This is one step on my long journey into programming, this was all very useful."
@enriquelmx,"at 16:57 the equivalent Powershell command to ""la"" or ""ls -la"" commands may be ""ls -force"" or ""Get-ChildItem -Force"". The ""ls"" command in Powershell is a Get-ChildItem alias.
Edit: guys I found this command really useful to see all the commits in different branches more visual-friendly: git log --graph  , you can add --oneline to display the info more summarized."
@rayfagalde423,best tutorial ive ever seen. bouta save my grade like a super hero
@basilali9767,Amazing platform for ever...i didn't seen ever before..i'm always waiting this video
@lckylke5751,"Showing hidden files on windows and in powershell wil work with ""dir -Force"" :) Good Tutorial btw"
@syundown6005,"Amazing tutorial, being a comp info systems student the only class I ever had that included GitHub only involved us uploading a Google Colab notebook to a GitHub repo a single time and from there every project I ever had just immediately assumed I knew how to use every corner of Git, so I'm only half way through this tutorial and it already feels like it has taught me so much."
@vashishtsharma7217,"This is free content so if you don't like it, You should tell her in the comments than disliking it."
@patrickvandersluis2796,"Gwen, once again you have created the exact video I needed. Thank you for the effort and commitment it takes to professionally produce these pieces. I have enjoyed many of your tutorials."
@khatwanik,Thank you Gwen for creating this simple and easy to understand content for both beginners to learn git basics and for experienced professionals to refresh and reinforce Git command line skills.

@erisaround,"if you can't use git bash instead of powershell in the terminal:
1.Reinstall Git Bash to primary drive (C:).
2.Check ""Add a Git Bash Profile to Windows Terminal""
3.Restart VS Code"
@uyiosaakpasubi6052,"Thank you so much for this, it was a really amazing video.

I resolved this by using the classic token"
@parlezvsfr,"Excellent tutorial ! Very clear. I spent last 2 - 3 hours following it step by step and I understood everything ! I had no difficulty in reproducing the path. And it is very practical. I am a UX UI designer, so a bit impressed with the code. But that was real smooth. Well done !!!"

@emanimal,"Hey Gwen, love the material I learned a lot. Thank you so much for taking out the time to do this,  myself and I am pretty sure others definitely appreciate it. Questions what is the extension you use on VS Code that gives you that nice looking late out and helps differentiate things. Maybe you can run by some extensions you think would make VS Code easier to use. Thank you."

Now I'm one step closer to it.
Thanks again and keep the good work you people are doing.
Regards from Chile."
@HolymanFMZ,"You don't realise the way you just save my entire career, That's really for dummies like i was in the beginnig of your tutoriel,

 thanks a billion times"
@percys8774,"Starts off ok and then starts rapidly jumping around and loses beginners. Doesn't specify where to type in the ssh-keygen. Are we still in VS Studio? It's amazing that new IT people ever get trained, because every expert is unable to go slow and explain things step by step. So sick of getting ditched by instructors because it's so easy for them and they forgot what's it like to be a beginner."

I've been using it for over a year now but some of the commands I just ran because that's how I'd seen more senior devs do it.  I really appreciated you explaining what some of the arguments mean (e.g. HEAD, origin, -u).  I know there is a ton more that git can do but from my experience this will give people 90% of what they'll ever use git for."

@christianleleux2535,A warm thank you for sharing your broad experience in such a clear way. First time I've the feeling to understand GIT in real workflow. Have a gooooood day.
@gustavocortez6569,"yoooo this is amazing! I love how you repeat the steps slightly differently. It really helps me understand how things work. I'm just a salesguy but this has been auper helpful, thanks!"
@chaceciulla9783,"Great pacing and easy to work alongside. Loved making all these commands work for the first time and having it all ""click"". Thank you!"
@rafaelsantos9086,"absolute beast of an instructor, thank you dearly!"
@j_force.90,"21:46 -  If the given command line doesn't work try using the following. (Got it from chatgpt and it worked.)

ls -Name | Select-String -Pattern 'testkey'  

The previous error which leads to the above solution might have occurred bcz of using windows powershell. Widows powershell doesn't have the 'grep' command natively available.
Instead we can use 'Select-String' cmdlet, which performs a similar function to 'grep'

Or else your can use grep command in bash:"
@philipheah6557,What a great lesson. Learnt a lot in just 1 hr. Great job. Thanks Gwen.

@evanwarren1010,"while i'm aware this is terrible reasoning, it's amazing how quickly I came to trust you as an educator after seeing the character lineup of Mother 2 on a shelf in the background."
@SifuNH,"Hello Gwen, Thank you for this tutorial. I support a plugin for VS Code and felt I needed to understand Git better to support my plugin. Mission Accomplished!!!"
-,I followed your tutorial step by step. I was able to get visual studio and github to interface. however I cannot commit and push my changes from my local on Visual Studio to my Repo on Github. I am utterly confused what I am doing wrong as I followed each step specifically you showed us. thank you for taking the time to make these helpful videos !

@jaimegarcia8447,"Loved this tutorial. Perhaps the best git tutorial I've found. Gwen's explanations are as clear and concise as they can be. 

That said, I feel the conflict management bit might have been expanded a bit though (I found a bit surprising that the conflict was fixed in the test branch but master was behind when the section finished - my knowledge is very limited so I might be talking rubbish though)."
@DheerajAeshdj,i got a clear understanding of how git and github works. thank you.

@orhannaseri,Thank you so much You saved me from a big problem. I was stuck on this topic for 2 weeks but your video helped me.
@mordest_porcket27,Had fun learning from you. However one thing you can add is to show how the processes differ between mac an windows i had a lot of issues following along since i primarily use windows. however i got insights from GitHub publishing.
@MariaAkterRimi-h9y,Your pronunciation is so clear! and the video of course was so good!
@uzairmughal4976,I am addicted to this channel already

@NsorEnya,Gwen! This was amazing!! I feel so confident with Git and Github already...thanks a lot!
@omikronweapon,"I feel there's a few steps that could benefit from some details at 25:03
trying to register my key, I found that -K wasnt recognised, while -k was.
also, as an absolute beginner, I failed to realise that ~/.ssh was refering to a directory the repo in the video didnt have.
so ""ssh-add -k testkey"" was what I needed"
@Ajoi14,That was a really nice intro! Now I understand the Merge Conflict way better! Thanks Gwen! 
@savithpanamgama2107,Got introduction to git and GitHub madam. Learnt a lot!!
@edwinantonius63,"Great explanation of how to use and integrate Git and GitHub into your IDE. Scrolling through the timeline it seemed that I could skip some topics since they don't cover the exact information that I was actually looking for. Only to find out later that one by one, most if not all of my questions are answered in these topics. Pleasant surprise. Great work!"
@hackeymabel8296,love all the hotkeys included in your speaking
@bl.fl.,Thank you for the tutorial! <3 This is the best explanation for Git & GitHub I've found so far and I've been looking for a while! It's perfect for super beginners.

@alexmondragon2594,"Hey guys, if anyone see a "".DS_Store"" file when you commit (with mac) , be careful! Usually this doesn't show when you have a "".gitignore"" file set to ignore it in you app's folder. Probably Gwen turned off the automatic creation of this file globally in her terminal by running: defaults write com.apple.desktopservices DSDontWriteNetworkStores true

You can turn it back on by running: defaults write com.apple.desktopservices DSDontWriteNetworkStores false

Thank you so much Gwen, FCC and this amazing community!"

@bearcountrypublishing5303,Thanks so much.  I have been struggling with git.   I've broken to many of my repos for sure.  I think this new knowledge will help me so much.  
@davidk7212,"I still can't believe Git actually changed the standard name ""master"" to ""main"". The sensitivity and the pandering truly knows no limits."
@randyraymor1963,"This is a very detailed video.  Unfortunately, being an older video, I found it difficult to follow.  For one thing, GitHub has changed a bit since this video was made.  But the real show stopper is that you are 90% devoted to Mac and I'm using Windows.  It's hard enough for some people to learn new things, let alone, trying to convert commands to different operation systems."
@arjunsemwal02,Thank you so much Ms. Faraday for sharing this great and helpful easy to understand tutorial 
@ph7305,"Thanks so much! At last I found a video for Git and GitHub that was clear, understandable! Great help."

@JamesJianDev,"This was a very insightful course into the fundamentals of GitHub for a newbie like me, so thank you! The bit that helped me a great deal was the brief workflow review clip at 30:26 that concisely went over the difference between Git flow and Git Hub flow. Once I understood that, the way Git works became less mystic and more understandable!"
@MsEdnira,Thank you for this carefully made and clear tutorial. Git is still a mystery to me  but things start to get more clear

@usheeg,The best video I've watched on Git
@atinjanki2651,"Great tutorial! You explained things in the simplest way possible. Enjoyed learning and understood everything you conveyed!
While following the video I noticed that doing 'git init' in the local repo creates a git repo with intial branch name - 'master'. This causes issue while pushing to the 'demo-repo2' as it has 'main' as the name of the branch."
@kiwibazza99,Thanks for creating and posting this video. Alot to take in but a great start into the world of Git...

@karthikshivegowda1704,I found this very useful trying to make sense of git coming from few years of other versioning system usage.
@archertal0762,As a beginner really appreciate it.
@tunichtgut5285,Great tutorial! I'd like to point out that the setup processes of the ssh-agent is Mac specific. On Linux distributions with systemd you'd use systemd/User to start ssh-agent upon login. Some distribution e.g. Ubuntu come with this service enabled by default while on others e.g. Arch Linux you have to set it up manually.
@josephaj8310,"Its the best, I looked every others and those were not good. Thanks for the teaching."

@rbid,"Very nice intro to git.

@fiyinfoluwaenis4786,"Thank you very much for making this video. 

I love this video because it is very simple and explains important concept. I also loved how you reinforced the knowledge you had already explained by using them such as git add and git status"
@CamaguNcoso,"I have been watching this video after installing Git on my Windows 10. There are few points I have to make

1. This video was created 3yrs ago, the GitHub was not yet advanced compared to how it is now. Yes I have Github account thanks to this video

2. Visual Studio Code is also advanced because there's an option that allows you to clone without going to the terminal. You simply copy the address of the repository you want to clone in Github and past it on the address box on VSCode.

Which makes the video to be outdated given the fact that VSC and Github have advanced since this video was shot. I struggled until I saw the differences between Github 2023 Sep 16 and the one used in the video(3yrs ago). Same applies for VSC, it is so advanced thanks to the developers of Microsoft

From there, I struggle to follow through bcos you're using a different operating system compared to Windows 10 That I'm using"

This video is the perfect content to get you from zero to proficiently using best practices in an hour. IMO there isn't an ounce of fluff in here. It's Goldielocks just right, not too light and definitely not too long.
Gwen does a great job of delivering the content, making it very easy to follow along and understand the logical flow.
Kudos, both thumbs up."

@Infuriated_draken,"Hey, great tutorial loved the way you explained in an easy to follow approach. Quick question at 55:37 you merged with master while staying on quick-test(sub-branch), it didn't bring any changes to the master branch. So what I meant to ask is if I to bring changes into my master branch I should do the opposite right!? But what is the difference between these two and in what type of scenarios do we have to use them?"

When we create a repo on Github, were will it create? 
Somewhere online?
Not locally.
So, probably it has its own disk space to create repos.
Where is that space?
Who configures where this space is?
Could we configure it to use my local disk space?"

If I now take the time to take some notes and make an outline of the steps, for reference until they become second nature, I will be on my way to successfully using git on a frequent basis for various tasks.  My  goal is to be able to setup a git repository with all of the bash aliases and scripts that I want in a repo so that when I setup new devices I can clone all that without futzing around with usb sticks and such.  Can you point me to such a goal?  Thanks."

first and foremost I want to thank you for this tutorial 
it's my first time dealing with git and those things and you make It clear to me
I have a question

i started watching these guys first then since i trust freecodecamp's organized style of explaining things(  because i learn from them), i started with your video first.

when i watched kevin's git tutorial, i noticed for unstaging he used restore -staged not reset, also for branching he used git branch branch_new_name but you used checkout ...
thanks , you slow speech helped stabilize first-impact ideas of git in my head. =)
happy coding."

@dgtlalchmst,"FWIW, 

git add vs git commit
----------------------------------
- ""git add"" sends a modified file in your working repository to the staging area; files are NOT committed
- ""git commit"" saves files from the staging area; takes a snapshot of your repository's current state, and creates a new revision with a log. each version has a unique identifier.

commit vs push
--------------------------
- commit only saves files locally 
- push sends committed (saved) files to a [specified] remote repository

working directory --> staging area --> local repository --> remote repository
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
working directory files are sent to the staging area via ""git add"". 
staging area files are added and saved to your local repository via ""git commit"".
local repository files are added to a remote repository via ""git push"".

the rabbit hole is deep. Happy new years!"

@mannistudio,"Luv'd this course.  BUT, I got myself in a bit of a jam.  I was in a directory that has several sub-dirs which also contain files.  I believe I accidentally typed in:  git add . (dot) which then added every subdir + files into git as untracked.  Not good as I now have many, many dirs & files in untracked status.  I did not do a commit (thank gawd).  So, i tried all kinds of combos of:  git clean;  git clean -fd & git rm --cached on just a few files or on a subdir/files (backed up of course) and found that these commands actually delete the file on disk along with untracked files in the work area.  This is really bad.  So how do I back out of this predicament? Here is an example.  Each dir ha many files:

$ git status -s
?? ./
?? ../Javascript/
?? ../SquareAPI/
?? ../Project X/
?? ../Project Y/"

2. how do you get your terminal to be set up like that where it shows the branch? my terminal doesn't show anything to indicate I am in git or which branch I am in (not in VS code and not in terminal either).
